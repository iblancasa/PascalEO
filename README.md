# PascalEO

The same as [Pythoneo](https://github.com/iblancasa/PythonEO), [Luneo](https://github.com/JJ/LunEO) and others.


### What do you need to run this?
You will need to install Pascal (in Linux the package is named fpc).

Then:
```bash
#To run Xover
fpc xover.pas
./xover

#To run bitflip
fpc bitflip.pas
./bitflip

#To run onemax
fpc onemax.pas
./onemax
```
